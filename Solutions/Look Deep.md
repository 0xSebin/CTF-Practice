# Looks like it is a mp4 file, right?
Open up your linux and type  
<code> binwalk Look\ Deep.mp4 </code>

you will see that it is a rar file.

So, extract it... You will see a image.

Open that image, Again you will find nothing.

use this command in your terminal  
<code>strings flag.jpg</code>

BOOM!!
You got the flag!
